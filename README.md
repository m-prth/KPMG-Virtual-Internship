# KPMG Virtual Internship
>By Parth Mistry

* It was a virtual Internship Experience provided by KPMG Australia om Insidesherpa.

* This internship gave me an oppurtunity to get an insight into the day to day development workflow of KPMG.

* It also helped me to get a perspective of how they deal with new problems related to data analytics.

* It was a perfect blend of management and technology to make data driven business decisions.

* Tasks that I completed under this internship are:
    
    * Data Quality Assessment
    * Data Insights
